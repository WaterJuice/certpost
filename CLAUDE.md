## Project Overview

certpost is a Let's Encrypt certificate manager written in Go. It has two binaries:

- **certpost-server** — issues and renews SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt (ACME v2 with DNS-01 challenges), manages DNS records (A and CNAME), and provides a web admin panel and API for certificate retrieval. Supports Cloudflare and Technitium DNS Server as providers, with the ability to use different providers for ACME challenges vs domain records.
- **certpost** — client tool that fetches certificates from a certpost server. Can save them as files (`fetch`) or run a TLS termination proxy with SNI routing and automatic certificate refresh (`proxy`).

**Zero dependencies** — Go stdlib only. Native crypto (no openssl needed). Single static binary.

## Language and Spelling

Use **Australian English** throughout:
- colour (not color)
- initialise (not initialize)
- sanitise (not sanitize)
- organisation (not organization)

## Common Commands

```bash
make help              # Show all available targets
make check             # Run go vet

## Architecture

### Server (`certpost-server`)

Two subcommands: `run` and `setup`. Both require `--data-dir` / `-d` (no default location).

- `setup` — interactive wizard to create config.json
- `run` — starts the HTTP server, requires config.json to exist

Server features:
- Uses `net/http.ServeMux` with Go 1.22+ method-aware routing
- Admin panel at `/` embedded in the binary via `go:embed`
- Per-domain API tokens (auto-generated when adding a domain, visible, rotatable)
- Cert retrieval API at `/api/cert/<domain>` authenticated by per-domain bearer token
- Creates A or CNAME records via the configured DNS provider when adding domains, removes them when deleting
- Background renewal goroutine checks daily, proactively renews the 2 oldest certs per cycle to keep them fresh, with a 30-day expiry safety net. Proactive renewal timestamp persisted to avoid re-issuing on restart. Errored domains retried automatically.
- In-memory log buffer viewable in admin panel Logs tab
- Info endpoints: `/api/version`, `/api/spec` (OpenAPI 3.0), `/api/help` (plain text)
- `/api/token-info` — resolves a bearer token to its domain

### DNS Provider

- `dns/provider.go` defines a `Provider` interface with methods for TXT, A, and CNAME records
- `dns/factory.go` provides a `CreateProvider()` factory that creates providers from config maps
- `dns/cloudflare.go` implements the interface for the Cloudflare API
- `dns/technitium.go` implements the interface for the Technitium DNS Server API
- The server uses two provider instances: one for ACME challenges (TXT records) and one for domain records (A/CNAME)
- A single `dns` config key can be used when both roles use the same provider; `dns_acme` and `dns_records` override individually for split configurations

### ACME / Let's Encrypt

- Implements ACME v2 protocol using `net/http`
- Let's Encrypt directory URL is hardcoded (no config needed)
- DNS-01 challenge: sets `_acme-challenge.<fqdn>` TXT record via DNS provider
- Native Go crypto: `crypto/rsa`, `crypto/x509`, `encoding/pem` — no openssl dependency
- No email registration with Let's Encrypt

### Client (`certpost`)

Three subcommands: `fetch`, `proxy`, `init`. No command shows help.

- `fetch` — downloads cert as `<domain>.crt` and `<domain>.key` files. Supports `--refresh` for periodic re-fetching. Can use CLI args or a JSON config file.
- `proxy` — TLS termination proxy. Fetches certs from server, terminates TLS with SNI routing via `tls.Config.GetCertificate`, forwards plaintext to backends. Auto-refreshes certs (default 24h). Requires JSON config file.
- `init` — interactive wizard to generate a fetch or proxy config file. Resolves domains from tokens via `/api/token-info` and validates against the server.

### Storage

- All data in a user-specified directory (`--data-dir`, no default)
- `config.json` — DNS provider settings, base domain, admin key, bind address, port
- `domains.json` — managed domains with status, target, per-domain API tokens
- `certs/<domain>/cert.json` — certificate PEM data with ISO timestamps
- `acme_account.json` — ACME account key and registration URL
- `renewal_state.json` — timestamp of last proactive renewal cycle
- Admin auth cookie is a SHA-256 hash of the admin key (no server-side session state)
- Atomic writes via temp file + rename, mutex-protected

### Auth

- Admin panel: login with admin key, cookie set to SHA-256 hash of key (optional "remember me" for persistence)
- Cert API: per-domain bearer tokens (generated on domain creation, rotatable)

## Testing Changes

After making changes:
1. Run `make check` to verify go vet passes
2. Run `make build` to verify the full build works
3. Test server with `./output/certpost-server run -d <dir>`
4. Test client with `./output/certpost fetch ...` or `./output/certpost proxy -c <config>`

## Versioning

- Version is injected at build time via `-ldflags "-X .../version.Version=..."`
- Create a git tag like `1.0.0` before running `make build` for a release (no `v` prefix)
- Falls back to `dev` if no tags exist

## Commits

When committing:
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Include `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>` in commits made with AI assistance
- **Never rewrite git history** unless explicitly asked to
